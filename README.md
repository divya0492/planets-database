# Planets-Database
Practice repository for learning Git workflows

## Description

This repository provides concise and well-structured information about the planets in our solar system. The content is designed to support academic learning, introductory astronomy studies, and general knowledge development.

The primary goal of this repository is to:
- Present key facts about each planet in a clear and accessible format
- Support students and beginners in understanding planetary characteristics
- Serve as a reference for educational and learning activities

## Overview

The planets of our solar system orbit the Sun and are divided into two main groups: terrestrial planets and gas/ice giants. The four inner planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars are rocky and relatively small, with solid surfaces. Beyond them lie the outer planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune which are much larger and made mostly of gases or ice, and all have ring systems. Each planet has unique features, such as Venus’s extreme heat, Earth’s ability to support life, Jupiter’s massive size, and Saturn’s prominent rings. Together, these planets form a diverse and dynamic system that helps scientists understand how planetary systems develop and function.

## Fun Fact

**Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system**, despite not being the closest to the Sun, due to its dense atmosphere and strong greenhouse effect.
